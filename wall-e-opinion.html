<h2>What is the movie Wall-e about?<h2>
<h4>WALL-E follows a solitary robot on a future, uninhabitable, deserted Earth in 2805, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship Axiom, a robot called EVE, with whom he falls in love and pursues across the galaxy.</h4>
<h2>Opinion (with spoiler btw)</h2>
<h4>I think that this movie was awesome not only because of the romance, but how it is expressed. Most movies and series now days, they express love with looks and kisses. If I could lie about this movie i'd say "I didn't cry during this movie", and well, now you know i cried during this movie. I loved how when both humans got out of their chairs they kinda fell in love and enjoyed life when everyone else was online. They were offline having fun, and that makes me wanna go out and celebrate for beying alive. And it's interesting how everything is handled by robots. The whole humanity was suppose to live in that spaceship for 5 years, but there were there for such a long time. </h4>
